0. What methods are there for doing this.
	- after research I used HTML <iframe> Tag

1. This app is useless for small screen devices.

2. The URL search bar is taking space that is necessary for the iframe.
	- fixed

3. I added some new controls: 
	- Refresh - reloads the URL
	- Rotate - rotates the iframe
	- new URL - shows the URL input
	- Custom input - allows the user to set it's custom screen size

4. The search is limited to 'http://example.com'
	- fixed - the user can use 'example.com' as well
	- switched from <input type="url"> to <input type="text"> for passing regex

4.1 Finding a new regex for 'example.com'
	- fixed - use ? after https like: https?

5. Refused to display 'https://www.youtube.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'.
	- fixed - By making a URL call

6. Is slow when testing big websites

7. The content in iframe is aligned to the window when the iframe is wide not the iframe itself.
	- fixed - Checking if the width of the screen is larger than the width of the document

8. Would be nice to have a button for zoom-out. 
	- possible with scale calculated for each size
