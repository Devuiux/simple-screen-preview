0. What methods are there for doing this.
	- after research I used HTML <iframe> Tag

1. This app is useless for small screen devices.

2. The URL search bar is taking space that is necessary for the iframe.
	- fixed

3. I added some new controls: 
	- Refresh - reloads the URL
	- Rotate - rotates the iframe
	- new URL - shows the URL input
	- Custom input - allows the user to set it's custom screen size

4. The search is limited to 'http://example.com'
	- fixed - the user can use 'example.com' as well
	- switched from <input type="url"> to <input type="text"> for passing regex

4.1 Finding a new regex for 'example.com'
	- fixed - use ? after https like: https?

5. Refused to display 'https://www.youtube.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'.
	- fixed - By making a URL call

6. Is slow when testing big websites

7. The content in iframe is aligned to the window when the iframe is wide not the iframe itself.

8. Would be nice to have a button for zoom-out. 
	- possible with scale calculated for each size
